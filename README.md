#####Looking Back Years Later:

CSC 335 was a course where we were challenged to take our Java skills to the **Expert** level.  As shown from the ICritter repo, throughout the weeks we evolved.  Basic methods -> Inheritance -> Complex data structures -> GUI interaction -> Exception handling -> Complex algorithms.  The course unfortunately covered networking briefly just before this project with no assignment.  So out of 30 groups, my group was one of 2 to create a WYSIWYG networked editor.  Learning by reverse engineering examples barely touched on in class, we managed to get something that magically worked.  Running this program now, some implementations we used are now deprecated, and solutions to our most complex problems are now staring us in the face.  It was a good experience being under dogs working through countless nights as a team to pull off something near impossible.

#####Post Project Reflection:  

After being graded by a class TA, this project recieved full points for the implementation of the WYSIWYG real time editor/chat system. 15 points extra credit were also awarded for making it exportable formatted HTML file and creating an annotation feature.  This project provided an excellent opportunity to first explore large scale programming projects as well as pitching the product which will help in later projects I worked on.   


#####If There Was More Time:  

Unfortunately we opted to do real time updates every few seconds to all connected devices, which caused some stability issues with multiple connected users editing at the same time on the same document.  With more time we would have liked to implement a way to time stamp the times of specific updates in order to not step over eachother.  Revision history of edits had to be scrapped last minute due to poor performance.  The bar on the right was designed to populate with revisions every 5 minutes as restore points for the document. There was an issue with the timer and couldn't fully integrate it before the deadline.
